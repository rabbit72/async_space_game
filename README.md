# Space Game
This is a console space game. It was written for studying asynchronous
programming in Python. 

# Requirements
Python 3.5+ should be already installed.

# Quick start

```bash
$ python3 space_game.py
```

Running on Windows is similar.

*(Possibly requires call of 'python' executive instead of just 'python3'.)*
